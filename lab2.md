In this lab assignment, we would like you to implement a code to automatically describe the content of an image by using CNNs and RNNs to build an Image Caption
Generator. Specifically, you will be implementing and training the model in the following paper with TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch on one of the datasets mentioned in
the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555

To lighten the burden on training the network, you can use any pre-trained network in tf.keras.applications.

Please submit your code and one-page document to explain your code by Nov. 20 in Canvas.
